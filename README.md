# Indonesian Sentiment Analysis from Tinder App

Tinder is one of dating application used by the global user. This project is aimed to perform sentiment analysis whether positive, negative, or neutral responds from spesifically Indonesian people.

## About

This project related to machine learning course. Here we are going to cleaning, preprocessing, and building various models from different algorithms. We would like to know more the quality of the model by evaluation of data testing accuracy.

## Data

The raw datasets contains 10k data from individually scrapped from Google Play API. The datasets has dominant negative labels that is followed up by balancing each of label equally using Resampling (Oversampling).

Data loaded and preprocessed:
- Removing punctuation
- Converting to lowercase
- Tokenizing
- Removing stopwords
- Applying stemming
